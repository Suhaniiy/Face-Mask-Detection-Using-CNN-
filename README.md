Face Mask Detection using CNN
Project Description:
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not from an image. The objective is to support safety enforcement during health crises by automating mask detection through deep learning and computer vision.
